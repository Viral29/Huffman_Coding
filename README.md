# Huffman_Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable length codes to input characters, the lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.


There are two Java file called henc5446.java which handles the encoding and hdec5446.java which handles the decoding.
