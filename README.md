# Huffman_Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable length codes to input characters, the lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code. Each character is represented by a different encoding string or binary character code (or code in short) in such a way that no encoding string is a prefix of another encoding string. Codes that have this property are called "prefix codes". Hufman's algorithm/encoding is a greedy algorithm that during its course of execution makes that choice that looks
best at that instant.

There are two Java file called henc5446.java which handles the encoding and hdec5446.java which handles the decoding.
